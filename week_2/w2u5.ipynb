    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the paramter, i.e. the end point of the sequence, is **not** part of the sequence. \n",

    "\n",
    "By using the step size the distance between the numbers in the interval can be defined. The step size can be negative as\n",
    "well as positive.\n",
